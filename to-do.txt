FORM MANAGER AND MANAGING FORMS

Default function:
1. Forms are always added by the FormManager onMount
2. Forms will default to being active at all times
3. As a result, if you can see a form it is active.

1. If you want a form to be visible but inactive, set the active prop to false
	active={false}
2. Form will remain in the managers this.forms object, but will be marked as inactive
